I'm very excited to introduce the new NSCoderNight website.

Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/mrh_is">Michael Helmbrecht</a> for the website design, <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_critz">Mike Critz</a> for his help with CSS and design issues, and <a href="https://twitter.com/segiddins">Samuel Giddins</a> for his invaluable efforts in setting up the Middleman templates for the site and the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/NSCoderNight/NSCoderNight">Travis CI continuous build system</a> that it relies on. And a special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/eschaton">Chris Hanson</a> for founding and fostering NSCoderNight all these years. This wouldn't exist without all your efforts.

The Mac/iPhone/etc. developer community has grown substantially since NSCoderNight started in late 2007. But I think NSCoderNight still stands out as a place where developers can just relax, hang out, and share tips. 

So go find your <a href="/chapters">local chapter</a> and attend, or <a href="/starting">start up a new chapter</a> chapter where you are. We're happy to help, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
