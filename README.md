# NSCoderNight

This GitHub repository is for the files that are fed in to the <a href="https://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a> static site generator framework to create the NSCoderNight website at <a href="http://www.nscodernight.com">http://www.nscodernight.com</a>.

Is is also for the results of that process, i.e. all the static website files for <a href="http://www.nscodernight.com">http://www.nscodernight.com</a>.

(TODO information about using Travis CI to actually generate the site.)
